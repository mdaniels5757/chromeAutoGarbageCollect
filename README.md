This script just runs Chrome's garbage collector periodically (every wait_ms milliseconds (where wait_ms > 60000), to be exact).

Made because there's some sort of memory leak in one script/gadget or another and I can't be bothered to figure out which.

The relevant Chrome flag must be enabled for this to work.
